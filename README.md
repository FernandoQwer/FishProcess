# Practical Assessment | Mobile & Frontend Developer

## Setup
📋 This repository contains instructions for a practical test. You can use any modern front-end technology of your choice (React, Vue.js, Angular, etc.). Ensure the application is responsive and user-friendly.

## Technologies (Suggested)
- 🌐 HTML/CSS
- 💻 JavaScript (React, Vue, Angular, or any other frontend framework)
- 📱 Mobile-Optimized UI (e.g., Bootstrap, TailwindCSS)
- 🎨 Custom Keypad Implementation
- 🗂️ Optional Backend (Node.js, Laravel, etc.)

## Tasks
You are tasked with building a **Mobile-Optimized Fish Receiving Interface** and a **Web/Desktop-Optimized Testing Interface** for a fish processing system.

### Mobile-Optimized Interface
1. 🐟 **Fish Receiving Interface**:
   - Create a UI to allow workers to receive fish by selecting the following attributes:
     - **Fish Type** (e.g., Tuna, Salmon)
     - **Fish Size** (e.g., Small, Medium, Large)
     - **Fish Grade** (e.g., A, B, C)
     - **Weight** (numeric input)
     - **Damage Weight** (numeric input)
   
   - 🛠️ **Custom Keypad**:
     - Develop a custom numeric keypad for the mobile interface. Do not rely on the default mobile keyboard. This keypad should be user-friendly and optimized for touch screens.
   
   - **Barcode Scanning**:
     - Simulate a barcode input field where workers can enter or scan the fish's unique barcode.

   - **Submit Button**:
     - Allow the workers to save the fish data after entering the required information.

2. 📱 **Mobile UI Considerations**:
   - Ensure the design is touch-friendly with large buttons, easy-to-read fonts, and quick data entry flow for users working in a fast-paced environment.

### Web/Desktop-Optimized Interface
1. 🧪 **Fish Testing Interface**:
   - Create a web-based interface where workers can enter test results for:
     - **Mercury Level** (numeric input)
     - **Histamine Level** (numeric input)

   - **Bulk Update**:
     - Allow the worker to select multiple fish barcodes and update their test results in bulk.

2. **Barcode Selection**:
   - Create an easy-to-use list or input field where users can select one or multiple barcodes.

3. **Save Test Results**:
   - Enable saving the test results individually or for multiple selected fish.

4. 💻 **Desktop UI Considerations**:
   - Design the interface to be mouse/keyboard optimized, with clear actions, form validation, and user-friendly navigation.

### Requirements
- **Mobile-First**: The fish receiving interface must be optimized for mobile devices.
- **Web/Desktop-Friendly**: The testing interface should be designed for web browsers on desktops.
- **Custom Keypad**: Implement a custom numeric keypad for weight input on mobile.
- **Barcode Functionality**: Include basic functionality for barcode entry (manual for the test).
- **User Experience**: Design with the end-user in mind, prioritizing simplicity and speed.

### Additional Guidelines
- **Error Handling**: Provide basic validation for input fields (e.g., non-empty, numeric inputs).
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the UI works well across multiple screen sizes.
- **Optional**: You can implement a basic backend using Node.js, Laravel, or any other technology of your choice to save fish data or test results. This is not mandatory but will add to the functionality.
